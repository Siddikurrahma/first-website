            <p> hat afternoon, Stephanie received a phone call that would change her life forever. Her son was in the
                hospital
                from a drowning accident. When Stephanie asked if they’d been able to revive him the voice on the end of
                the
                line would only say, “Drive safely!.” In that instant Stephanie realized she didn’t care if her son was
                handicapped; she only wanted him to be alive. </p>

                As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
