            <p> hat afternoon, Stephanie received a phone call that would change her life forever. Her son was in the
                hospital
                from a drowning accident. When Stephanie asked if they’d been able to revive him the voice on the end of

                line would only say, “Drive safely!.” In that instant Stephanie realized she didn’t care if her son was
                handicapped; she only wanted him to be alive. </p>
